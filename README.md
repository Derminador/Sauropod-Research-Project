# Sauropod-Research-Project
# Exploring body mass trends in Sauropodomorpha across the T-J boundary

## Description

Analysis of Dinosaur body mass trends of the T-J boundary are analysed and compared. Special attention hereby is given to the difference between the clade of Sauropodomorpha compared Theropoda and/or Ornithischia.

# I Max of the Stammberger admit that the Acolyte is bad


## Code

	1. Special headers are added
	2. An age midpoint for every dinosaur is calculted for later use
	3. Body mass is log transformed
	4. Scatter plots are created
		- every datapoint + every datapoint with linear smoothing
		- every datapoint but using log transformed data with linear smooting
		- Sauropodomorpha compared to non sauropodomorpha with linear smoothing
		- All triassic data + all triassic data with linear smoothing
		- all triassic data using log transformation with linear smoothing
		- all trassic data comapring sauropods to non sauropods with linear smooting
		- repeating the triassic steps with the jurassic time period
		- after every plot, mean values and slopes where calculated
	5. Boxplots specifically for sauropodomorpha are created
		- t test is perforemd to check for significant differnce between the two datasets
